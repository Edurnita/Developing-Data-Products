A dataset containing 13 chemical measurements on 178 Italian wine samples is analyzed. For that, a K-means cluster analysis of the data is performed. The number of clusters is determined by user. Since K-means cluster analysis starts with k randomly chosen centroids, a different solution can be obtained each time the function is invoked. Indeed, the variables vary in range, so they are standardized prior to clustering.
